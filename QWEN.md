# CV Page Project

## Project Overview
This is a Curriculum Vitae (CV) / Resume web page project, likely intended to be a personal portfolio website showcasing professional experience, skills, education, and other relevant information. The project appears to be in its initial stages with the directory structure just being set up.

Since the directory is currently empty, this project will need to be developed from scratch. Based on the name "CV PAGE", the goal is likely to create a professional online resume that can be hosted on the web.

## Project Type
Personal CV/Resume Web Page - This will be a client-side web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to present professional information in an attractive and responsive format.

## Technology Stack (Planned)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Styling**: Likely Bootstrap or custom CSS for responsive design
- **Possible Enhancements**: Font Awesome for icons, AOS library for animations, or other lightweight libraries for enhanced presentation
